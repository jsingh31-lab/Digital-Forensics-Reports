# Labs Overview

# Lab 1: Forensic Imaging
- Created forensic disk images using **FTK Imager**, **dd**, and **Kali Linux**
- Verified data integrity with **MD5** and **SHA1** hash values

# Lab 2: NTFS File System Analysis
- Investigated **NTFS artifacts** like Alternate Data Streams (ADS), timestomps, and encrypted folders
- Analyzed disk images using **HxD Hex Editor** and **Autopsy**

# Lab 3: File Carving & Hashing
- Recovered deleted files (JPG, PNG, DOC, PDF, etc.) using **Foremost**
- Validated image integrity through hashing and analyzed files at the byte level using a **hex editor**

# Lab 4: Memory Forensics
- Simulated a system compromise using **Armitage/Metasploit**
- Captured memory with **DumpIt** and used **Volatility** to identify malicious processes and SMB activity

# Lab 5: Communication Artifacts
- Extracted email content and credentials from **POP3/SMTP traffic** using **Wireshark** and **NetworkMiner**
- Captured and analyzed **IRC traffic** to reconstruct real-time chat logs

# Tools Used
- **FTK Imager**, **dd**, **HxD**, **Autopsy**, **Foremost**, **Volatility**, **Wireshark**, **NetworkMiner**, **Armitage/Metasploit**, **tcpdump**
